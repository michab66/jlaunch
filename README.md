# LaunchJava

Yet another Java launcher for Windows. Unique features are:
* Starts an application from a JLink generated installation.
* Works with Java 10+.
* Is small and so simple, that it can be easily adapted to special needs.

# Preconditions
* Requires Microsoft Visual Studio.  Version 19 was used for the implementation.
* Requires a JLink-generated, ready-rolled Java application.  That is, you need to hava a module name and the name of the main class at hand.

# Project config
* For debugging, set the location of the jvm.dll to use.
* Link against the jvm.lib that comes with your Jdk.
* Add the include directory and the include/win32 directory of your Jdk installation to the include path of the Visual Studio project.

# How to use it
The launcher generated with this project is a small executable that has in its resources an icon as well as in its string reaources the start class name and the module name of the Java application.

This is generated by adding adding the icon and the necessary text resource definitions in the project.

The executable that the build generates has to be placed inside the JLink-generated file structure into the directory where jvm.dll is located, this is commonly bin/server.
