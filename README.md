# jlgen

Yet another Java launcher generator for Windows. Unique features are:
* The generated launcher starts an application from a [JLink](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jlink.html)-generated application image.
* Knows about (jigsaw) modules.
* Works with Java 10+.
* Automatically creates the necessary icon resources from a single .png image.

Many other fine launchers exist.  But after a long search we did not find one that was able to work with Java 11 and application images generated by JLink.  jlgen is in use today as part of our Windows build chain for generating Java-JLink-based native Windows installers for a set of commercial applications. And no customer knows it's Java :)

## How to generate a launcher

Get the latest version of the jlgen executable from the project's [release page](https://github.com/michab66/jlaunch/releases).

`jlgen.exe` is a command line application that supports different commands. The command *`MakeLauncher`* represents the central functionality of the software.  It generates a native Windows launcher for a JLink-generated Java application image.  The command line is

    `jlgen MakeLauncher <target.exe> <icon.png> <application module> <start class>`.

The required parameters are:
* The name of the target file, e.g. 'Farboo.exe'.  If the .exe extension is not specified then it is added.
* The name of an icon file that is used to generate the required icon resources in the executable, e.g. 'farboo.png'.  Note that a *.png* file is required, no hassle with generating an .ico file.  It is recommended to offer a square, high resolution image, though all sizes and resolutions will do.  This image gets scaled and resized for the resolutions 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 pixels.
* The name of the target module. That is, the name of the module that holds the main Java application. For example `app.mmt`.
* Finally, the name of the Java class representing the entry point to the application.  This class has to offer the Java-application's `public static void main( String[] argv )` operation.  An example is `de.michab.app.mmt.Mmt`.

A complete sample call may look like 

    `jlgen MakeLauncher C:\cygwin64\tmp\Farboo.exe ..\mmt-icon-1024.png app.mmt de.michab.app.mmt.Mmt`.

## I have the launcher executable, what now?
Note that the generated launcher--in our example 'Farboo.exe'--has to be placed in the existing jlink image directory hierarchy at the same position where the file `jvm.dll` is located.  This is currently `{jlink-app-root}/bin/server` but this may change in coming versions of the Jdk.

In Windows Explorer the launcher is displayed with the application icon that was passed to `jlgen.exe` above.  On a double click your application opens, joy starts :)

The next step for professional application packing is to create a native Windows installer based on the JLink file system including the `jlgen`-generated launcher that has to be configured as the start application.  We use the [WiX toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) for this purpose, but this is a different story.

See the [project Wiki](https://github.com/michab66/jlaunch/wiki) for more information on the remaining `jlgen` commands and if you want more info on `jlgen` development.
