# jlgen

Yet another Java launcher generator for Windows. Unique features are:
* The generated launcher starts an application from a [JLink](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/tools/jlink.html)-generated application image.
* Knows about (jigsaw) modules.
* Works with Java 10+.
* Automatically creates the necessary icon resources from a single .png image.

Many other fine launchers exist.  But after a long search I did not find one that was able to work with Java 11 and application images generated by JLink.

## How to use

Get the latest version of the jlgen executable from the project's [release page](https://github.com/michab66/jlaunch/releases).

`jlgen.exe` is a command line application that supports different commands. The command *`MakeLauncher`* represents the central functionality of the software.  It generates a native Windows launcher for a JLink-generated Java application image.

The required parameters are:
* The name of the target file, e.g. 'Farboo.exe'.
* The name of an icon file that is used to generate the required icon resources in the executable, e.g. 'farboo.png'.  Note that a .png file is required, no hassle with generating an .ico file.  It is recommended to offer a square high resolution image, though all sizes and resolutions will do.  This image gets scaled and resized for the resolutions 16, 32, 64, 128, 256 pixels.
* The name of the target module. That is, the name of the module that holds the main Java application. For example `app.mmt`.
* Finally, the name of the Java class representing the entry point to the application.  This class has to offer the Java-application's `public static void main( String[] argv )` operation.  An example is `de/michab/app/mmt/Mmt`, note that you have to use `/` in this name instead of the `.`s used for example in `package` references.

A complete sample call may look like 

    `jlgen MakeLauncher C:\cygwin64\tmp\MMT.exe ..\mmt-icon-1024.png app.mmt de/michab/app/mmt/Mmt`.
